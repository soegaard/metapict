@section[#:tag "ref-pict"]{Pict Adjusters}

All images in MetaPict are represented as @racket[pict]s. A @racket[pict]
is a structure that holds information on how to draw a picture. 
A @racket[pict] can be @emph{rendered} to produce an image in various
formats such as PNG, PDF, and SVG. 

The standard library @racket[pict] defines several functions to
construct and manipulate @racket[pict]s. MetaPict provides and
offers some extra operations. Since they are not MetaPict specific,
they are also useful outside of the world of MetaPict.

A few of the @racket[pict] operations are provided under new names. 
The basic concept in MetaPict is the curve. Therefore it makes sense 
for, say, @racket[circle] to return a curve. In the @racket[pict] library 
the name @tt{circle} returns a @racket[pict], so to avoid a name conflict
it is exported as @racket[circle-pict].

An attempt has been made to make the @racket[pict] the last argument
of all operations. This explains the existance of a few functions whose
functionalities overlap with the @racket[pict] library.

The operations in this section operate on @racket[pict]s, so use
@racket[draw] to convert curves into @racket[pict]s.

@subsection{Pen Adjusters}

@defproc[(color [c color?] [p pict?]) pict?]{
Draws the pict @racket[p] with a solid pen and brush of the color @racket[c].

@defproc[(penwidth [w real?] [p pict?]) pict?]{
Draws the pict @racket[p] with a pen of width @racket[w], a real number between 0 and 255.
Same as @racket[linewidth].

Adjusts the current pen cap, and then draws the pict @racket[p].

The cap determines how the end of curves are drawn.
The default pen is @racket['round].}

Adjusts the current pen join, and then draws the pict @racket[p].
The available joins are: @racket['round], @racket['bevel], and, @racket['miter].
The join determines how the transition from one curve section to the next is
drawn. The default join is @racket['round].

Note: If you want to draw a rectangle with a crisp 90 degree 
outer angle, then use the @racket['miter] join.}
